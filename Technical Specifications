Core Components
1. PriceOracle (Mock):
- Provides TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) for governance token
- updatePrice() for testing price changes (replace with Pyth Network in production)

2.BinaryOption:
- ERC20 token representing European-style options
- Pays 1:1 in USDC if token price > strike at expiry
- Auto-exercisable after expiration date

3.FuturoGovernance:
- Manages DAO proposals and voting
- Issues binary options instead of returning locked tokens
- Integrates with oracle for strike price calculation

Workflow
1.Proposal Creation:
- Any user creates proposals with description
- 7-day voting window starts immediately

2.Voting
- Users lock FTR tokens to vote for/against proposals
- Tokens remain locked until proposal execution

3.Execution:
After voting ends:
- Calculate strike price (current TWAP + 50%)
- Deploy options contract
- Fund contract with USDC (1:1 to locked tokens)

4.Option Distribution:
- Voters claim options proportional to locked tokens
- Options expire after 1 year

5.Exercise:
- After expiration, option holders automatically exercise if in-the-money
- Receive USDC payout if token price > strike
